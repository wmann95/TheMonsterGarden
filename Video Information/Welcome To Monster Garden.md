# [[Mana Core Incident]]
The Mana Core was a facility that produced mana saturated fuel that suddenly disappeared. Presumably this was an explosion as all that was left was a crater.

This incident caused [[Veruse]] to go to war with [[Ram]].

# Ongoing war
All that is left after the mana core incident is that of a wasteland filled with mazing tunnels and trenches, and "strange happenings". What's left of both of these civilizations are housed within bunker cities that are heavily fortified to the point of stalemate.
