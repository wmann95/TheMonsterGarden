All dwarves smoke a substance called grot and often indulge in drinking as well. They ask others to join their drink and smoke and enjoy watching them horribly fail at handling them. I myself couldn't resist their eager request for me to join. Their drink was consumed though a cup shaped similar to a smoking pipe. You are to quickly suck up the drink like a shot, as I did, the flavors hit me like a brick wall. Spiceness, peppery, floral, and funky notes all overwhelming. I had a coughing fit immediately as it burned its way down and my fellow drinking partners seemed incredibly ammused by this. For the rest of my journey into their caverns my head felt hot and I had trouble focusing.

Dwarves are the creators of golems. They also create metalcrafts unmatched in quality by any other race. Despite this, their largest export is that of jewelry and precious gems.
