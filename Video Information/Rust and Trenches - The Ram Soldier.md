# Lore
The armor is solidly protective and relatively unencumbering. Soldiers either get a new suit of armor if they are lucky or are given armor that has been scavenged from the dead and repaired. At the begining of the war, armor and weapons were made uniquely by their respective armorsmiths and weaponsmiths, wherein each creation was almost a work of art. Some soldiers are partial to these old relics of a bygone era and will even trade for them. Modern armor is simpler as to be easier to manufacture at higher scales. Soldiers are armed with scrolls such as that of the [[Fire Bomb Scroll]], [[Rooting Scroll]], and the [[Flamethrower Scroll]].
