# Description
[[The Rat Catcher]] is a mysterious figure who scavenges mage's bodies from the battlefield to experiment and collect [[Tar]]. He collects the [[Thimbles]] of these mages and is proficient in many magics. He hangs them on his arms. The collection of these bodies is done with the assistance of a cane he brings with him that has a menacing hook on it. He also smokes from a pipe, loosely based on Meershaum pipes (ipa: /meːɐ̯ʃaʊ̯m/, german). He would smoke the pipe followed by playing a flute in order to cast illusory magics. He is also proficient in terraforming magic. He caries boxes on his back that caries his tools, but also other trinkets that he likes to collect. Corvids such as crows and ravens accompany him.

# Story: "Broken Doll"
The tale is told in mists of halls and shadows of inns of a stalker in the mud and the fallen on battlefields across the land.

Once he was a simple mage, driven by power and zeal to serve and to conquer those that would resist. He marched ahead, trudging past his allies as their lungs filled with water, sucking it's fetid moisture from the dirt as his wide still waided through slop and gore. Once, they were men to him, they're lives have been of keen interests in barracks and bases, where nightly they would share stories of heroism and longing of home.
Their bodies ached, their joints creaked, as their bones grew inches daily as their use of mana took further grip upon them. Commanders before crucial battles would hand out rations of tar, to be chewed upon as the need arose, a boost of their power to surmount any task before them. But as cannon fire took his comrades by the platoon, he alone stood upon the battlefield, frozen in fear, as if a standing corpse. The horror of the battlefield that day instilled in him a new greed for power.

"Commander!" He shouted before his superior, once returning from the battlement. "Commander, I need but a moment of your time... Please, I beg of you!"

"For your valiance, you have two." The stalwart man replied.

"Commander, I must know, from where do we get our tar? It powers us, and drives us to our deaths, but in the same pressing jawstroke it may secure victory!"

"You shall not wish for this knowledge, but to you and to you alone, I shall give it."

The shorter man paused, staring up at the face of the gaunt mage.

"It is from the bowels of your own kin. Cut from them once they cease to breath."

The young mage looked on in terror. He shook in his boots to his bones. Though, in the far reaches of his consciousness, he raced to know the secrets of its extraction.

Years passed, as well as soldiers, falling upon the horde on rain soaked plains, and the young mage was no longer young. Every night, in the dead of it, stretchers rushed from crazed orders to collect the fallen so that their latent power may not fall into enemy hands. But he knew their power would soon become his own, rationed to be tins to be passed out the next day. The time since he first learned of the tar's origin, he had been planning his own methods to extract it more purely, and in the coming months he tested each one. After all, nobody missed a single body from the hundreds each day. Some sank into the mud, and some were stolen by robbers in the night, of which he was becoming.

His methods improved, from sloppy, jagged cuts, and boughts of vomitting from knowing who they were, he carved away until he could cleanly extract the lumps of mana that rested within their prisons. From there he boiled it, fried it, cooked it, and baked it. He crushed and dried it, tempered it with dyes and solutions and his fellows watched with the time that passed he grew unfathomable features, none that should belong to a man. His arms grew long and thing, his bones brittle when starved, but strong as iron when fed with tar. He carried a cane with him, a metal hook comprised its handle, which he would use to drag bodies away from the fray, boiling them in tubs of fat to leech away the impurities so his cuts would be cleaner.

The old commander soon passed as his years wore on, not supported as mages were by mana that coursed through their viens. Their teeth stained black by it's daily rations.

"I knew him," the not-young mage said. His face now hung loosely from bone beneath, twisted and warped by his cruel processes. Any who knew him from before would no longer call him their friend, but a fiend that cast on foreign fields with cruel magics.

"In my years of service, I have seen men torn to shreds and others built up by the mountains of corpses that piled at their feet." Those who listened felt the weight of the words that fell from his lips. "I myself have must attribute my success to those who have fallen around me, and I will ever deny it, nor relinquish my purpose, but my purpose is no longer requiring me to see to the wounded or to fell those who would oppose me. Nay, I will apply my craft elsewhere, this vile craft I have made."

Within a fortnight, he was gone. Whispers in the night told of a stalking creature that roams the darkness after the cannons have fallen asleep. Bodies disappear without a trace. The deliveries of tar find their ways to barracks on both sides, for a price.

Should you find yourself in the horrors of battle, you should watch from every side, for the mud hides more than it shows. Shells covering men wearing scavenged pieces from those who died too close. If you fall, you may never be found.
