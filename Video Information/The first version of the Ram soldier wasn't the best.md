- Originally meant to be a well-rounded soldier.
- Was supposed to be a mix of world war 1 and medieval armor
- Different periods had to come together to mix and work
This doesn't work because:
- The medieval armor and weaponry doesn't "feel" right.
- Painting the armor makes it look more like a toy soldier
- The helmet. Quote: "How the hell does this guy see..."
